## 💡 The Mission
**EnvironmentalJustice AI** is an interactive platform designed to democratize access to complex environmental data. By combining US-based EJ datasets with advanced Gen-AI, the project empowers activists, policymakers, and community members to identify environmental inequities and generate data-backed advocacy materials in seconds.

## ✨ Key Features
*   **🔍 Natural Language Insights:** Ask complex questions like *"Show me the correlation between air quality and low-income housing in Detroit"* and receive concise, data-driven summaries.
*   **📊 Interactive Data Visualizations:** Dynamic mapping and charting of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and census data.
*   **📜 Policy Brief Generator:** Automatically draft localized policy recommendations based on specific community risk factors.
*   **🛡️ Risk Scoring:** Real-time calculation of environmental burden scores for specific US zip codes using integrated EJScreen metrics.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **Core Engine**

![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white)

### **Intelligence & Data**
*   **Generative AI:** OpenAI GPT-4 / LangChain for semantic search and synthesis.
*   **Data Science:** Integration with EPA EJScreen API and Census Bureau data.
*   **Frontend:** React.js / Tailwind CSS for a high-performance, accessible UI.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
*   An API Key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
*   (Optional) [EPA EJScreen API](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/ejscreen-api) access

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/environmentaljusticeAI.git
    cd environmentaljusticeAI
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
    EPA_API_KEY=your_key_here
    PORT=3000
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *Access the interface at `http://localhost:3000`*

## 🧩 How It Works
1.  **Ingestion:** The app pulls real-time environmental metrics (PM2.5 levels, lead paint presence, proximity to superfund sites).
2.  **Contextualization:** The Gen-AI engine processes these raw numbers alongside historical socioeconomic data.
3.  **Interaction:** Users interact with the data through a chat-like interface, lowering the barrier to entry for non-data scientists.
